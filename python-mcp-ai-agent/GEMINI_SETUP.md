# Setting Up Gemini with MCP AI Agent

## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

The MCP AI Agent has been successfully updated to use Google's Gemini AI instead of OpenAI. Here's how to set it up and test it.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Python Dependencies**: Already installed
2. **Gemini API Key**: You'll need to get one

## 🔑 Getting a Gemini API Key

### Step 1: Visit Google AI Studio
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"
```

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### Step 1: Start the Test Server
```bash
# In one terminal
python test_server.py
```

### Step 2: Test the Natural Language Interface
```bash
# In another terminal
python main.py chat --connector http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Try Natural Language Commands
Once in the interface, try these commands:

```
"Create a new workflow for database migration"
"Register Alice as a DBA"
"Propose an action to update the database schema"
"Review and approve the pending proposal"
"Execute the approved action"
"Show me the audit log"
```

## 🎯 What You'll Experience

## 📊 Example Session

```
🚀 Welcome to MCP AI Agent

You: Create a new workflow for database migration and register Alice as a DBA

🤔 Thinking...

🧠 AI Reasoning:
I need to create a workflow and register an actor. I'll use the start_workflow tool to create the workflow and register_actor to add Alice as a DBA.

🔧 Tool Calls Executed:
1. start_workflow (workflow)
   Arguments: {'title': 'Database Migration'}
   Reasoning: Creating a new workflow for database migration

2. register_actor (workflow)
   Arguments: {'name': 'Alice', 'role': 'DBA'}
   Reasoning: Registering Alice as a DBA for the workflow

📊 Execution Results:
1. start_workflow - ✅ Success
   Result: {"workflow_id": "workflow_1"}

2. register_actor - ✅ Success
   Result: {"actor_id": "actor_1"}

📝 Summary:
I've successfully created a new workflow called "Database Migration" and registered Alice as a DBA. The workflow has been assigned ID "workflow_1" and Alice has been assigned actor ID "actor_1". You can now proceed with proposing actions for this workflow.
```
