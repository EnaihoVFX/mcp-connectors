### 2. **MCP Client (`mcp_client.py`)**
- Connector management and communication
- Tool discovery and execution
- Protocol handling for MCP connectors

### 3. **CLI Interface (`cli_interface.py`)**
- Rich terminal interface with colors and formatting
- Interactive natural language prompting
- Conversation history and context management
- Help system and user assistance

### 4. **API Server (`api_server.py`)**
- RESTful API endpoints for integration
- Web-based interface capabilities
- Server-side processing

## üß™ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complex Workflow Creation
**Query:** "Create a new workflow for database migration and register Alice as a DBA"

**What Happens:**
1. AI analyzes the request and identifies two required actions
2. Creates a new workflow for database migration
3. Registers Alice as a DBA with appropriate permissions
4. Provides comprehensive summary of the setup

**Tools Used:**
- `start_workflow` - Creates the migration workflow
- `register_actor` - Registers Alice as DBA

### Scenario 2: Database Schema Proposal
**Query:** "Propose an action to update the database schema by adding a users table"

**What Happens:**
1. AI understands the request for schema change
2. Creates a detailed proposal with table specifications
3. Includes proper reasoning and parameters
4. Submits for review and approval

**Tools Used:**
- `propose_action` - Creates schema change proposal

### Scenario 3: Proposal Review and Approval
**Query:** "Review and approve the pending proposal"

**What Happens:**
1. AI identifies the pending proposal
2. Reviews and approves the database schema change
3. Ensures proper governance procedures
4. Prepares for execution

**Tools Used:**
- `review_action` - Reviews and approves proposal

### Scenario 4: Action Execution
**Query:** "Execute the approved action"

**What Happens:**
1. AI executes the approved database schema change
2. Creates the users table with specified columns
3. Provides audit trail and execution details
4. Confirms successful completion

**Tools Used:**
- `execute_action` - Executes approved proposal
